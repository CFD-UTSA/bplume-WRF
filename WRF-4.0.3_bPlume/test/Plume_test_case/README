This folder contains namelist and WRF case setup files to simulate a buoyant gas released into idealized ambient air with no stratification

The source is located at the center of the bottom boundary 

Case set-up:
  Gas released                = Ammonia, specified through plume_gas_constant
  Plume source diameter       = 400 m 
  Plume source flux           = 10 g/kg m/s
  Surface heat flux           = 0 K m/s
  Domain size                 = 4km x 4km x 7km
  Grid size                   = dx=dy= 40 m, dz=10 m
  Run time                    = 30 min
  Output frequency (Eulerian) = 0.1 Hz
  Time step                   = 1/6 sec

The myoutfields.txt file is included to restric writing of unwanted variables to WRF output stream (This reduces the output file size written by WRF)

The input_sounding has a constant temperature profile throughout the domain and no mean winds

The tslist file has indices that are read by WRF to write the high-frequency output, which is used for turbulence calculations

Note: The tslist included is suitable only for the domain size mentioned in the namelist.input 
If grid size or domain size in horizontal are changed, this tslist file will no longer work as intended

In addition, a MATLAB script to read/convert the instantaneous files written by WRF to .mat format is also included
